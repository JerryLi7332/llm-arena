# LLM Arena

**LLM Arena** is a **strategy game battle platform powered by large language models (LLMs)**.

Previously, [PKULAB409](https://github.com/pkulab409) developed an LLM-based gaming platform for the campus network, where users could program in Python to create AI agents powered by LLMs and play the game *Avalon* ([pkudsa.avalon](https://github.com/pkulab409/pkudsa.avalon), simplified version: [python.avalon](https://github.com/pkulab409/python.avalon)).
We now plan to refactor and expand this platform to create **a richer and more complete LLM-based strategy game battle platform** — LLM Arena.

In LLM Arena, users can programmatically call LLMs to participate in strategy game battles, or join community co-creation to design and upload new strategy games to the platform.

Our goal is to popularize AI knowledge, accelerate AI applications, and explore the future possibilities of artificial intelligence.
